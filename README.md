Those are the  3D printable files that you can use to try and recreate this experiment. 
I personally 3D printed all the files in PLA, the nozzle temperature at 220 degrees, the bed temperature (in my case it was a glass bed) at 60 degrees. The infill percentage was at 30% and the printing speed was 150 mm/s (a lower speed can be used too), for the first layer it was 30mm/s to stick the print to the bed. The layer height for every piece was 0.2mm. 
The files are .stl and they need to be sliced by a software such as  Cura3D.
In order to obtain the complete structure you need to put the graaphite thin layer between the 2 pieces called "Grid_holder.stl" and "Piece_in_between.stl".They can be interlocked by just using some pression, you can even use some sandpaper in order to remove some volume and make them slide better. Te two pieces "Piece_in_between.stl" and "Cathode_anode.stl" are locked together by using mechanical spines of aluminum, I obtained them
by just cutting a thin aluminum screw in 4 pieces. 
If you don't see the files press to "view code" to show them.
