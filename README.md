Those are the  3D printable files that you can use to try and recreate this experiment. 
I personally 3D printed all the files in PLA, the nozzle temperature at 220 degrees, the bed temperature (in my case it was a glass bed) at 60 degrees. The infill percentage was at 30% and the printing speed was 150 mm/s (a lower speed can be used too), for the first layer it was 30mm/s to stick the print to the bed. The layer height for every piece was 0.2mm
